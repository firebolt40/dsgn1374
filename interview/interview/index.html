										<h3>What do you enjoy about web?</h3>
										<p>web development is an exciting career because it's always evolving and constantly changing. This means you'll always have the opportunity to interact with new tools and learn new skills, keeping you engaged in your career. It's a field that provides many opportunities for hands-on learning. Web Design is something new to me so it will take some time to improve and I also really enjoy learning about different codes - KD </p>

									<h3>What are your thoughts on design?</h3>
									<p> You can really get creative with design and step out of your comfort zone. Stepping out of your comfort zone will help you go further with design. The goal of design is to learn from your mistakes and improve upon them. Mistakes help with progress! - KD </p>
									<p> I completely agree! Design is meant to be out of your comfort zone, it really helps you learn and even make mistakes. You see if you never ever step outside your comfort zone how will you make mistakes? how will you find a new style or technique you really enjoy? - ME </p>

								<h2>What do you want to improve upon?</h2>
								<p>What I want to improve on my design work is to get even more creative with it. - KD</p>

								<p> When you think about it, getting creative with design is actually way easier than you think. For example you wanted to draw a pegasus maybe for the wings you could add feathers instead, thats what I did for a project in highschool! - ME </p>
