									<h3>Our Inspiration</h3>
									<p>An example of inspiration is breathing in through your nose and out your mouth. A person or thing that moves the intellect or emotions or prompts action or invention. Gandhi has been an inspiration to political reformers for decades. Something, such as a sudden creative act or idea, that is inspired.</p>
									<p> I find my inspiration mostly from my family. My mom, dad, and my sister -KD</p>
									<p> Personally I also get my inspiration from my family,friends and my boyfriend as they all motivate me to succeed and keep my head high - ME </p>

							<p>Why are families so good at inspiring you? </p> <p>They have a hard time accepting that not everyone can honestly communicate the way they can. Therefore family inspires you to learn how to adapt to human behaviors that are different from their own. They spend time getting to know people from all walks of life and study their thought process in various situations..

									<p>Conquering fresh territory is exhilarating â€“ and one more reason why people love to travel. Humans crave new experiences and travel lets us tap into that craving. A trip is the perfect time to do something different and exciting, especially something you can't do at home</p>
