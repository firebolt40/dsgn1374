								<p>Imagine that you have before you a flagon of wine. You may choose your own favourite
vintage for this imaginary demonstration, so that it be a deep shimmering crimson in
colour. You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most
exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent.</p>
								<p>They say that wine glasses are parallel to typography. There is the long, thin
stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between
your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly
meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page.
When Reading this article about comparing wine glasses to typography or should I say "Books" You can really start to see the similarities.</p>

								<h3>FIRST OFF WHATS A CRYSTAL GOBLET?</h3>
								<p>The Crystal Goblet is often referred to in typographic circles for its thesis that encourages the humble use of typography to serve the text instead of vanity. She compares typography to goblets and notes that those who know something about wine, or profess to, will prefer a clear crystal goblet</p>

								<h3>" There is no end to the maze of practices in typography"</h3>
								<p>this idea of printing as a
conveyor is, at least in the minds of all the great typographers with whom I have had the
privilege of talking, the one clue that can guide you through the maze.</p>

								<h3>" I once was talking to a man who designed a very pleasing advertising type "</h3>
								<p> I remember that T.M. Cleland, the famous American typographer, once showed
me a very beautiful layout for a Cadillac booklet involving decorations in colour. He did
not have the actual text to work with in drawing up his specimen pages, so he had set the
lines in Latin. This was not only for the reason that you will all think of; if you have seen
the old typefoundries' famous Quousque Tandem copy (i.e. that Latin has few descenders
and thus gives a remarkably even line)</p>
