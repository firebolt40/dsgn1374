								<h3>First off what is a handmade web?</h3>
								<p>The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.</p>

								<p> It is said that handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late 1990s, in the brief period after the academic web and before the corporate web and that ‘Handmade’ is by no means the only or best term to define the web of this period. Some people such as Olia Lialina describes the 1990s web as " bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection and a more powerful computer" She also many talks about how the web has emereged. The handmade web mainly emereged when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic relationship. " This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most influential online writing communities in the world." This reading also talks about the interesting things of the online archive of the trAce Online Writing Centre like, how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere — manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium within which they were created.

								<h3>Media Archaeology</h3>
								<p>(2011) Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox.</p>

								<h3>The Web We Lost</h3>
								<p>(2012), Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."</p>
